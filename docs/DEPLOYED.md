Subject: Buddi Student Wellbeing MVP - Live Demo Ready

Dear [Interviewer Name],

I've developed a working MVP of "Buddi" - an AI-powered student wellbeing platform tailored for Singapore's education system. This demonstrates my product thinking and technical execution relevant to the Senior AI Product Manager role.

🔗 Live Demo: https://buddi-mvp.vercel.app

**Quick Start (5 minutes):**

1. Choose a persona on the landing page:
   • Wei Ling (Student, 14) - Experience gamified wellbeing tools
   • Ms. Priya (Counselor) - See AI-powered early intervention
   • Mr. Tan (Teacher) - View privacy-protected class analytics

2. Explore the features for that role
3. Switch roles anytime via dropdown (top-right)
4. Try bilingual mode: EN ↔ ZH (top-right toggle)

**Key Features Demonstrated:**

Student Experience:
✅ Daily mood check-in with gamification (XP, streaks, levels)
✅ 5 CBT micro-exercises (evidence-based cognitive techniques)
✅ 6 guided mindfulness sessions (exam stress, sleep, focus)
✅ Progress dashboard with mood trends

Counselor Dashboard:
✅ AI-powered priority queue (risk-sorted students)
✅ Explainable AI risk scoring (mood trend 30%, keywords 25%, etc.)
✅ AI-generated case summaries for flagged students
✅ Conversation starters for interventions

Teacher Dashboard:
✅ Privacy-protected class wellbeing pulse (≥5 student threshold)
✅ 8-week mood trend visualization
✅ Anonymous aggregate concerns
✅ No individual student data exposed

Platform:
✅ Full bilingual support (English / 中文简体)
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ Production-optimized build (270 KB gzipped)

**Technical Implementation:**
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- 30 components, 8,500+ lines of code
- Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts
- Built in 2 days as rapid prototype

**Product Thinking:**
- Privacy-by-design approach (teacher aggregation, counselor oversight)
- Gamification without trivializing mental health
- Singapore context (exam stress, bilingual from day one)
- Explainable AI for trust and transparency
- Cost-effective ($1.50/student/year vs $5-15 international apps)

**Documentation:**
I've also prepared comprehensive documentation:
- Demo guide with 3 scenarios (30 min walkthrough)
- Executive summary with cost projections
- Technical architecture and roadmap

This MVP showcases how I approach product development:
1. Deep user empathy (students, counselors, teachers)
2. Balancing innovation with ethics/privacy
3. Rapid prototyping to validate concepts
4. Technical feasibility demonstration
5. Stakeholder-ready presentation

I'm excited to discuss how this aligns with MOE's vision for student wellbeing and AI integration in education.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best regards,
Raymond Luo

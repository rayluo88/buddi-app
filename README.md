## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Even though this is a demo with synthetic data, privacy-first design is implemented:

### Student Privacy
- Individual data only visible to student + counselor
- Teachers see aggregate data only
- 5-student minimum threshold for all metrics
- Students can delete journal entries

### Teacher Dashboard Privacy
- ✅ Can see: Class averages, trends, anonymous concerns
- 🚫 Cannot see: Individual students, journal entries, risk flags
- Privacy explainer modal with clear examples
- "Contact counselor" pathway for individual concerns

### Data Protection
- All data is synthetic (no real students)
- No authentication required (demo mode)
- No data persistence (localStorage only)
- Clear "Demo Mode" indication

### Production Considerations
- LTI 1.3 authentication for SLS integration
- Encrypted data (TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest)
- PDPA compliance
- Audit logging for counselor access
- Parental consent for students <13
